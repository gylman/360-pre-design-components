It turns out that the size is borders with paddings, not with margin.
So, basically, if you make a child component width 100% and give him some margin the child component will overflow the parent, because he has to have the same width as the parent's width.

If you want to transition multiple properties in CSS, try this:

.menu {
  transition: color 1s ease, margin 1s ease;
}
